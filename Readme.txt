Competition name :Materialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5
Competition Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/imaterialist-challenge-fashion-2018
Architecture used : Convolutional Neural Network

Since: Since the data has to be downloaded via the json file provided and the actual dataset is extremely huge(around 120k images) , and due
to my hardware limitations(even google colab wasnt able to handle such a huge dataset),I have trained the model on only 10k images.
I have provided my jupyter notebook code as well the the trained weight for the model
